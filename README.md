# Interactive Pollen Visualisation Tool

This is a project to develop an interactive web tool to assist researchers in visualising and comparing pollen analysis data between study sites.

The tool will draw on data from the European Pollen Database ([EPD](http://www.europeanpollendatabase.net)) to generate interactive plots allowing researchers to explore and compare pollen abundance time series between study sites. We will achieve this using the [Python](www.python.org) language, and in particular the [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) interactive plotting library.

We hope to not only provide a useful, attractive and open tool to help compare pollen abundance data from different sites, but also to show off what's possible when visualising data with Python in general. The project was born out of a [Nuffield Research Placement](http://www.thebrilliantclub.org/the-brilliant-club-for-researchers/nuffield-researchers-placements-2/) taking place over 4 weeks at [King's College London](www.kcl.ac.uk) during the summer of 2017.
